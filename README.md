# Song_generator_RNN

This repository contains a basic lyrics generator built with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) using a dataset from Spotify, sourced through Kaggle. The model is trained to generate song lyrics, taking inspiration from existing songs in the dataset.

üìö Dataset

The model is trained on the Spotify Million Song Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset/data?select=spotify_millsongdata.csv), a large collection of song lyrics. The dataset provides a rich variety of lyrics from numerous artists, making it a suitable foundation for training the RNN model.

üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a lyrics generator that can produce coherent and creative lyrics. While the current version is trained on a dataset from a single artist, future iterations will expand to include a more diverse set of lyrics, enhancing the model's ability to generate varied and contextually appropriate lyrics.

Key Features:

RNN-based Lyrics Generation: Utilizes the power of Recurrent Neural Networks to generate song lyrics based on patterns learned from the dataset.
Spotify Dataset Integration: Leverages a comprehensive dataset of song lyrics from Spotify, facilitating the generation of lyrics that reflect contemporary musical trends.

Future Enhancements:

Improved Model Accuracy: Further training on a more diverse dataset to enhance the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually sensible lyrics.

Genre-Specific Lyrics: Introduce functionality to generate lyrics based on specific genres or moods, such as sad, happy, or upbeat lyrics.

Expanded Dataset: Incorporate lyrics from a broader range of artists and genres to improve the diversity and richness of generated lyrics.
